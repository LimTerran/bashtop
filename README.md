## Description

Resource monitor that shows usage and stats for processor, memory, disks, network and processes.

## Features

* Easy to use, with a game inspired menu system.
* Fast and "mostly" responsive UI with UP, DOWN keys process selection.
* Function for showing detailed stats for selected process.
* Ability to filter processes.
* Easy switching between sorting options.
* Send SIGTERM, SIGKILL, SIGINT to selected process.
* UI menu for changing all config file options.
* Auto scaling graph for network usage.
* Shows message in menu if new version is available
* Shows current read and write speeds for disks
* Multiple data collection methods which can be switched if running on Linux

## Themes

Bashtop now has theme support and a function to download missing local themes from repository.

See [themes](themes) folder for available themes.

The builtin theme downloader places the default themes in `$HOME/.config/bashtop/themes`.
User created themes should be placed in `$HOME/.config/bashtop/user_themes` to be safe from overwrites.

Let me know if you want to contribute with new themes.

## Upcoming

~~Currently rewriting to use python3 [psutil](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil) for data collection instead of linux specific tools.
This will add python 3 and psutil as dependencies, but will make bashtop cross platform compatible.~~

~~This will be integrated in to main version when done and add the possibility to switch between psutil and linux tools for users running linux.~~

Bashtop is now Mac OS X and FreeBSD compatible!

#### Python port

Work on a complete python port ~~will begin this summer~~ has begun. My aim is to keep it compatible with pypy3 for a lot of added efficiency.

PyPyTop?

## Support and funding

Bug fixes and updates might be slow during normal workdays since I work full time as an industrial worker and don't have much time or energy left during the week.
I'm looking into ways of funding this project that would allow me to take off time from my day job to work on this.

Any advice on how to get funding for open source projects is very welcome!

#### Update

You can now sponsor this project through github, see [my sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/aristocratos) for options.

Also added donation links for [paypal](https://paypal.me/aristocratos) and [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/aristocratos).

Any support is greatly appreciated!

## Compatibility

Should work on most modern linux distributions, on Mac OS X and on FreeBSD.

Will not display correctly on the standard terminal on OSX!
Recommended alternative [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/)

Will also need to be run as superuser on OSX to display stats for processes not owned by user.

The disk io stats on OSX and FreeBSD shows iostats for all disks at the top instead of per disk.

For correct display, a terminal with support for:

* 24-bit truecolor
* Wide characters

Also needs a UTF8 locale and a font that covers:

* Unicode Block “Braille Patterns” U+2800 - U+28FF
* Unicode Block “Geometric Shapes” U+25A0 - U+25FF
* Unicode Block "Box Drawing" and "Block Elements" U+2500 - U+259F

#### Notice

Dropbear seems to not be able to set correct locale. So if accessing bashtop over ssh, OpenSSH is recommended.

## Dependencies

## Linux, OSX and FreeBSD

**[bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)** (v4.4 or later) Script functionality will most probably break with earlier versions.
Bash version 5 is highly recommended to make use of $EPOCHREALTIME variable instead of a lot of external date command calls.

**[GNU coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/)**

**[GNU sed](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/)**

## Linux using /proc for data collection

**[GNU grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/)**

**[ps from procps-ng](https://gitlab.com/procps-ng/procps)** (v3.1.15 or later)

**[GNU awk](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/)**

## OSX and FreeBSD or Linux using psutil for data collection

**[Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)** (v3.6 or later)

**[psutil python module](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil)**

## Optionals for additional stats

(Optional OSX) **[osx-cpu-temp](https://github.com/lavoiesl/osx-cpu-temp)** Needed to show CPU temperatures.

(Optional Linux) **[lm-sensors](https://github.com/lm-sensors/lm-sensors)** Needed to show CPU temperatures.

(Optional Linux) **[iostat (part of sysstat)](https://github.com/sysstat/sysstat)** Needed if you want disk read/write stats and are not using psutil data collection.

(Optional OSX/Linux/FreeBSD) **[curl](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html)** (v7.16.2 or later) Needed if you want messages about updates and the ability to download themes.
